### Detecting Subtle Land Cover Change and Addressing its Climate Impact in an Interdisciplinary Framework of Ecology and Economics - 2024/09/06

Basic Information: Land-atmosphere interactions: - Energy - Water - GHG

Research questions: 1) Develop model to detect subtle land cove changes - Current models differ a lot in land cover change detection - Developed model: interaction between bands for remote sensing It can detect wildfires, port and urban development

2)  Climate impact of forest disturbance Forest VS. Forest disturbance region low albedo high albedo high ET low ET

-   Land Surface T changes after disturbances
-   Surface albedo (may recover or increase, consider about changes in ecosystems), increase after disturbances
-   Precipitation changes Climatic zones with more precipitation shown a greater reduction in ET and requires longer recovery

3)  Choice of bioenergy crops to minimize the efficiency and decrease their impacts on climatic disturbances Biogeochemical impact: sugar beets saved most GHG emissions \<-\> soybean least Biophysical impacts: Social costs: Implications -\> Government encourage the cultivation of bioenergy crops for biofuel production by providing susbsidies

### Plant Diversity, climate change, and conservation: The view from California - 2024/09/10

Micro climate could impact species distribution. Different species found on north and south slopes

Inbound Species: Species that can move into certain area as outbound species move away Outbound Species: species that move to higher elevation due to hotter weather

### Climate Extremes and the Carbon Cycle (2013/08/15) - 2024/09/17

**Why study?** *Problems*: Earth system models shown combined effect of CO2, climate change and nitrogen deposition leads to increased vegetation productivity -\> enhanced carbon sinks in temperate and boreal regions. But extreme Events (heatwaves, droughts, storms) offset carbon sinks -\>releasing CO2 to the atmosphere *This study look into*: Investigate the diverse impacts of climate extremes on the carbon cycle of terrestrial ecosystems

**Key Study Points**:
1. Extreme Events affect the carbon cycle concurrently and initiated lagged responses
2. Drought is the most widespread factor affecting the carbon balance in forests

An extreme climatic event defined as: an episode or occurrence in which a statistically rare or unusual climatic period alters ecosystem structure and/or functions well outside the bounds of what is considered typical or normal variability.

2. European 2003 heatwaves, precipitation (soil moisture) deficit rather than temperature was the main factor reducing water and carbon fluxes in temperate and meditteranean forest ecosystems

3. Severe and recurrent droughts have been identified as a major contributing factor in the recently accelerated rates of tree decline and mortality of forests (17, 29-31)

4. drought is also a relevant driver of the physiology and carbon cycling of the highly productive tropical forests

5. Amazonian forests were estimated to have lost 1.6 petagrams (1015 g) of carbon (Pg C) and 2.2 Pg C following the severe droughts of 2005 and 2010, respectively (refs 30 and 32).
