### Detecting Subtle Land Cover Change and Addressing its Climate Impact in an Interdisciplinary Framework of Ecology and Economics - 2024/09/06
Basic Information:
Land-atmosphere interactions:
- Energy
- Water
- GHG

Research questions:
1) Develop model to detect subtle land cove changes
- Current models differ a lot in land cover change detection
- Developed model: interaction between bands for remote sensing
It can detect wildfires, port and urban development

2) Climate impact of forest disturbance
Forest VS. Forest disturbance region
low albedo   high albedo
high ET      low ET
- Land Surface T changes after disturbances
- Surface albedo (may recover or increase, consider about changes in ecosystems), increase after disturbances
- Precipitation changes 
Climatic zones with more precipitation shown a greater reduction in ET and requires longer recovery

3) Choice of bioenergy crops to minimize the efficiency and decrease their impacts on climatic disturbances
Biogeochemical impact:
sugar beets saved most GHG emissions <-> soybean least
Biophysical impacts:
Social costs:
Implications -> Government encourage the cultivation of bioenergy crops for biofuel production by providing susbsidies


### Plant Diversity, climate change, and conservation: The view from California - 2024/09/10

Micro climate could impact species distribution. Different species found on north and south slopes

Inbound Species: Species that can move into certain area as outbound species move away
Outbound Species: species that move to higher elevation due to hotter weather
